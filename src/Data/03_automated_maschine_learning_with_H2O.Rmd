# Challenge
## Question 1 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Monthly Income and Attrition?
There is a big spike of people having attrition at the low end of the monthly income spectrum far greater than people having no attrition with low monthly income. This indicates that monthly income has a relatively strong affect on attrition.
## Question 2 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Percent Salary Hike and Attrition?
The attrition graph depending on the percent salary hike is nearly identical for people with attrition and without. Meaning a percent salary hike has very little effect on attrition.
## Question 3 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Stock Option Level and Attrition?
The attrition vs. stock option level graph shows that people having a stock option level of 1 or to a lesser extend 2 are much less likely to have high attrition, meaning there could be a positive effect between the stock option level and attrition for the employer.
## Question 4 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Environment Satisfaction and Attrition?
First of all, the satisfaction levels of the survey seemed to be clumbed in certain levels which is likely the result of some kind of numerical scale being used for this survey (Rate from 1 to 4 for example). Considering that, there is an upward trend in the number of people having no attrition with higher satisfaction.
## Question 5 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Work Life Balance and Attrition
The work life balance seems to indicate a stronger connection with attrition, with people rating their work life balance more positively having less attrition.
## Question 6 | What Can you deduce about the interaction between Job Involvement and Attrition?
People that are more involved in the job are less likely to have attrition.
## Question 7 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Over Time and Attrition?
Roughly the same amount of poeple that have attrition do and do not perform overtime. But as a percentage, the poeple doing overtime are much more likely to have attrition.
## Question 8 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Training Times Last Year and Attrition
There is a slight trend, that more training time results in less attrition but as far as I can tell very minor.
## Question 9 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Years At Company and Attrition
Regarding years at the company for very new people the attrition is much higher than for those that are very long with the company.
Crucially those that stay long have very low attrition, since most likely those with high attrition left at some point, so the data is inherently somewhat skewed.
## Question 10 | What can you deduce about the interaction between Years Since Last Promotion and Attrition?
Years since last promotion seem to have a rather small affect on attrition but the small bump in attrition if people are longer with the company is notworthy, meaning that people that stayed with the company for an extended amount of time without a promotion start to get more attrition.
